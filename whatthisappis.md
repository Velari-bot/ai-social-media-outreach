What this app is (in plain English)

This app is an AI-powered creator outreach assistant.

Instead of manually searching for creators, emailing them one by one, chasing replies, and organizing rates in a spreadsheet, the app does all of that for you automatically, using your own email.

You tell it who you want to work with.
It finds them.
Emails them.
Handles the replies.
And builds your creator list for you.

The core problem it solves

Creator outreach today is:

Manual

Time-consuming

Disorganized

Hard to scale

Easy to mess up (spam, missed replies, lost info)

This app turns creator outreach into a set-and-forget system.

What the user actually does

Signs up

Connects their email

Chooses creator criteria (platform, niche, country, views, followers)

Pastes their outreach message

Clicks “Launch”

That’s it.

What the app does for them

Behind the scenes, the app:

Finds creators that match the criteria

Pulls public contact emails

Sends outreach from the user’s inbox

Monitors replies in real time

Uses AI to understand responses

Automatically asks for missing info (rates, phone number)

Organizes everything into a clean database or sheet

The user wakes up to qualified creators, prices, and contact info — not inbox chaos.

What makes it different

This is not just:

An email tool

A scraper

A CRM

It’s an AI negotiation + organization layer for creator outreach.

Most tools stop at “send emails.”
This tool finishes the job.

Who it’s for

Agencies doing influencer outreach

Brands hiring creators

Growth teams running campaigns

Later: anyone who works with creators at scale

If someone says “We need to email a lot of creators”, this app is for them.

One-sentence version (very important)

An AI assistant that finds creators, emails them from your inbox, handles the replies, and builds your creator list automatically.

Why it’s valuable

Removes human error
